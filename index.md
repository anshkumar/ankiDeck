## Welcome to Anki-Deck

You can download the deck from here and use it with [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download) to memorize electrical engineering formulae. Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. Anki uses spaced repetition flashcard to help you memorize fast.

The SM2 algorithm, created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, forms the basis of the spaced repetition methods employed in the program. Anki's implementation of the algorithm has been modified to allow priorities on cards and to show cards in order of their urgency.
